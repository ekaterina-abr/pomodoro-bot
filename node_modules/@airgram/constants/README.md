# TDLib constants

Telegram API contains so many types of objects and updates. It's easy to make a typo or miss some changes when new version of TDLib is coming. To prevent it, Airgram provides a package with names of all the types, predicates and updates.

See [details](https://airgram.io/guides/advanced-topics/use-constants).
